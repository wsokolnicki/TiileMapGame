# TileMapGame
Game with tiles mechanics 

Just a simple game with two levels. Just find a way to get into a teleport and don't get kill by any obstacles.

- I've get to know how to work with Tiles in Unity.
- I've played around with Particle Effects, creating a teleport to next level, which sucks player inside.
